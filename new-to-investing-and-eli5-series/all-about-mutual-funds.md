# All About Mutual Funds

## What is a Mutual Fund?

A mutual fund is an instrument / vehicle by which a company \(called Asset Management Company or AMC\) collects money from investors by selling units / shares and using that money to make investments. Depending upon the aim, a mutual fund can invest in equities, bonds, a mix of both, gold, international equities, other funds, etc. So, mutual fund automatically does not mean equity mutual fund. There are some 4000 odd funds presently.

### **Portfolio:**

The combined list of different securities of the fund is called the Portfolio. Because of transparency requirements, the companies have to tell their portfolios on their sites. Different sites like Morningstar.in, moneycontrol.com, and valueresearchonline.com also show these details along with other characteristics.

### **Net Asset Value \(NAV\)**

This is the price of 1 unit of the particular mutual fund. It is calculated by adding the market value of all the securities \(equities, bonds, gold, etc\), subtracting the market value of the liabilities and then dividing this value by the total number of shares / units.

Mathematically, NAV = \(Total market value of Assets – Total market value of liabilities\) _divided by_ \(number of units / shares\)

_Features:_

* It is calculated daily at the end of the trading sessions and should be available at 7pm. Some funds, like those which have securities of foreign assets, can have delayed announcements of their NAVs.
* If the underlying market value of the securities \(shares, bonds, gold\) increases on that day, the NAV will increase and vice versa.
* One can purchase / sell the mutual fund at the announced NAV of the day. Usually, the selling and purchasing NAV are similar, but in some cases that can be different. 
* Most funds allow buying / selling of fractional shares also. Since, everything is mathematical. A fund can collect ₹1,00,000 and issue 1000 units with NAV of 100. Other one can collect the same ₹1,00,000 and issue 10,000 units at NAV of 10. The underlying net value of the fund is same, only the NAV value is different because of different number of units. **This is why when somebody tells you that a fund with NAV of 10 is better than a fund with NAV of 300, you should not agree to it.** The total fund value depends upon the securities and not the NAV. Better to run away from that guy for investing advice. 

### **Dividend Income**

When a mutual fund announces dividend, it pays out that dividend money from the net assets and gives it back to the investors. There is no additional money generated. If the NAV is 100 and the company announces a dividend of 5, you will get 5 in your account and the NAV would fall to 95. Your own money is given back to you. It is not like you will get 5 in your account _and the NAV would continue to be 100._

### **NFO \(New Fund Offer\)**

Companies come up with new portfolio guidelines or asset balancing, etc and create a particular mutual fund for that purpose. One can read about the details of the NFO on their site or SEBI’s. Usually, they are sold at NAV of 10 \(but it is just an arbitrary number\). The underlying philosophy of the fund is what is important and before buying a NFO, one should see whether that philosophy fits into the overall requirement. Any NFO requires lot of advertisement \(online, offline\), seminars, selling, etc – all these expenses are deducted from the net assets \(in the liabilities section specifically\) and gets reflected in the NAV. For 99% cases, don’t invest in NFO.

### **Expense Ratio**

The funds charge a specific amount of money for using the services. In most cases, this charge is applied on a daily basis and comes under the Liabilities head in the calculations. If a fund charges 2.5% expense ratio, then it would cut about 0.01% on each working day \(5 days a week for 52 weeks\) from the net assets and give you the final NAV. For lower expense ratio funds, this value will be lesser. Presently, each of the mutual fund have 2 types – a regular / retail plan and a direct plan. In the direct plan, if you invest directly with the AMC through their office / website AND you opt for Direct plan, you will get a lower expense ratio plan \(by about 0.5-0.6%\). All other methods of investing, namely agents, demat account, banks, investment accounts, etc can only use Retail / Regular plan.

### **Types of Mutual Fund**

_Open-ended Mutual Fund_ – The buying and selling of the units from the AMC is open. If you buy, they create more units at the day’s NAV and if you sell, they remove those units.

_Closed-ended Mutual Fund_ – For a 3 year closed fund, the AMC does not allow creation / deletion of units for that period of 3 years. After 3 years, it can either convert it into an open ended fund or pay back the money and close it. During the 3 year period, the investor can buy/sell the units on the exchange \(NSE/BSE\) from other unit holders. Sometimes, the buying / selling price can be different from the NAV of the fund because of supply and demand forces. And sometimes, one may not be able to sell it if there are no other buyers. There can be 5 year funds too. FMPs \(Fixed Maturity Plans\) are a type of closed-ended funds.

### **Advantages of Mutual Fund**

1. **Diversification:** Most funds have a number of different securities in their portfolio. Some can have stocks of 25 companies, while others can have stocks of 100 companies. There are guidelines which prevent the companies to invest in only 3-4 companies. This prevents severe loss in case 1 company does a fraud and its stock price collapses. Same is the case with the bond funds. They can have bonds of different companies and even if 1 or 2 companies default, the overall NAV does not go down to zero. 
2. **Affordable:** With ₹500 / 5000, you can go and buy a mutual fund and get that diversified portfolio. If you want to replicate that kind of diversified portfolio on your own, you will have to have a big amount.
3. **Professional Management:** The management team employed by the AMC use their expertise, research and analyses to manage the portfolios. This is better than most of the investors. The main point is that the aim of the management is _same_ as that of the investor – to maximize the NAV \(investment value\).
4. **Liquidity:** By definition, the open-ended mutual funds can be sold back to the AMC and the money can be received in the bank account. Depending upon the type of fund \(this will be mentioned in the scheme document\), it can take 1 to 10 days for the amount to get transferred.
5. **Convenience:** Most of the things like buying, selling \(partial/full\), statements, tax statements, etc. can be done online. Except for the KYC \(know your customer\) norms which has to be done in person \(called In Person Verification\). And everything can be done by going to the AMC office or common services like of CAMS / Karvy. Automated investment plans can be done in the form of SIP \(Systematic Investment Plan\) or SWP \(systematic withdrawal plan\) and their variations. 

## Types of Mutual Funds

### INCOME OBJECTIVE

You have to opt for dividend option if you want to get the dividend declared to come to your account. Alternatively, you can opt for growth option and ask for a specific amount of money as per needs to get the actual income. This can be automated with SWP or it can be done as per your request.

### Liquid Funds

These are also called Money-market funds. These types of mutual funds invest in highly liquid and high credit rated securities with very short maturity time frames \(usually less than 1 year\) like CD \(certificate of deposit which is a big FD\), government securities, commercial papers, and corporate bonds \(AA+ and above, mostly\). They usually pay higher interest rates than corresponding FD or savings account rates and are extremely safe. The last 1 year average return is around 8.9% and the forward yield is around 8.7%. The 5- year return has been 8.1%. \(Time-End Nov 2014\). Source – Morningstar.in. Reliance MF has an ATM card which you can associate with their funds. [Link](https://www.reliancemutual.com/investor-services/innovative-products/reliance-any-time-money-card). I don’t have personal experience with it.

### Bond Funds \(Debt Funds\)

Bond funds have the aim to earn more than the liquid funds by investing in a portfolio of bonds and other instruments. Depending upon the underlying specific objective, bond funds can be of the following types:

**Ultra-short Term Bond funds**

These use bonds for up to 3-6 months in most cases. They can invest in government as well as corporate bonds.

**Gilt Short Term Bond funds** Funds which exclusively invest in government \(gilt is for gilded = backed by govt\) short-term securities. They are safer than funds which invest in corporate bonds.

**Short Term Bond funds** These use bonds up to 1-3 years.

**Income Funds** These are usually flexible funds which can change their portfolio according to the interest rate outlook and tend to provide with a less fluctuating income.

**Gilt Medium to Long Term funds**

These use government \(gilt\) bonds, which have longer maturities. Currently, some of the funds have average maturities of 20-25 years.

### GROWTH OBJECTIVE

These funds have the objective of increasing the value of the fund. The equity funds will come under this group.

**Large cap funds** These funds invest in equities / stocks of the top 30/50/100 companies. Cap is for capitalization, which refers to the total stock market value of the company.

**Mid and Small cap funds** These funds invest in stocks of companies which are not Large-cap. They do so by having a mandate of not investing in companies which are in the top 50 or top 100 by market capitalization size.

**Micro cap funds** These funds invest in companies which are not in the top 200 or top 300 companies.

**Flexi cap or Multi-cap funds**

These have flexible mandate to invest in any group of stocks and not limited like the above 3 groups. They may additional restrictions like not investing in very small stocks. The idea is to invest in a particular group according to market conditions – so they can become large cap during one phase and small cap in another phase. Or they can have some money in large cap and some money in mid-small cap phase so as to have benefits of all worlds in a single fund.

**Sectoral Funds**

These funds in a particular sector only, like infrastructure, banking, capital goods, pharma, etc. which are defined in their scheme document. Many infrastructure funds have pretty wide coverage and do not invest only in specific infrastructure companies.

**Regional and Country Specific Funds**

These funds invest in a particular region / country of the globe.

**International Funds** These funds invest internationally without restriction to a specific country.

**Gold / Thematic funds** These funds invest in gold ETFs or gold mining companies, commodities, agribusiness, real-estate, real asset companies. Thematic funds appear like sectoral funds on the surface, but a theme is much larger than a single sector. Infra funds are usually considered thematic instead of sectoral, since the companies cut across various sectors related to infrastructure - banking and finance, engineering \(who finances the projects\), construction \(who builds them\), energy, metals and automobiles \(where do the raw materials come from and who transports them\) etc.

**Ethical / Socially Responsible Funds** These funds do not invest in companies associated with “sin products” like gambling, cigarette, porn, alcohol, etc. The Shariah related funds come under this.

### GROWTH AND INCOME OBJECTIVE

**Balanced Funds** These have variable allocation to equity and debt. There are equity-oriented hybrid funds which have &gt;65% equity allocation, while others are debt-oriented hybrid funds which have lesser amounts of equity \(can go to 5-10%\). They have an in-built asset re-allocation based on changes in the values of the securities.

**Asset Allocation funds** These funds use other funds to manage the assets. Many life cycle funds and dynamic ratio funds come under this head.

### ETF

Exchange traded funds are a separate type of mutual fund. These funds can be bought / sold during the trading hours on the Exchange and these track the price of the underlying portfolio. So, a nifty index ETF can have a variable NAV throughout the trading period, while a nifty index mutual fund will only have a single NAV for the day declared at the end of the trading hours.

## What and Why of Mutual Fund Ratings

AKA **Mutual Fund Rankings do not make Sense! Or Do They?**

You will find lot of media \(print, TV, blogosphere, sites\) screaming their heads off about 5 star funds. Friends swearing about some sites about 5 star funds. I will try and dissect the methodology of this, and then the disadvantages.

1. The major sites \(valueresearchonline, morningstar, moneycontrol\) first categorise different funds in different categories, according to their own whims and fancies \(if you will check, they will tell you they have definite criteria but all those criteria are based on relatively short-term periods of recent past, eg. 1 year or 3 year\). Few years back, VRO had a group of Diversified Equity, which later got divided into Large, Large-midcap, Multicap, Mid-Small cap. In future, it can happen with the higher number of funds, that there will be a Large-Medium-Mid and a Medium-Mid group too \(who knows!\). 
2. Plus, according to their current portfolio, different funds are kept in different groups at different times. Eg, a flexi-cap fund like HDFC Equity will be placed in Large-mid cap fund group at one time, while at other times it will be put in multi-cap group \(which is actually its group\). So, the place of individual funds can change over time. Which means, if you categorise HDFC Equity as a 5 star fund in the large-mid cap fund group and later on, its group changes to multi-cap, then the rating of 5 star of large-mid cap is just junk for this particular fund. \(For clarity sake, HDFC Equity can invest in any company, will prefer to get mid and large companies, and since its benchmark is CNX 500 \(major 500 companies, so it is best characterised as a multi-cap\).
3. The method of Rating. A Risk adjusted Return is followed which includes a lot of maths, usage of exotic terminology like 'downside risk', 'utility function theory','risk aversion', etc. Then they compare monthly/weekly returns with a riskfree return \(savings bank account rate or short term FD\), and assign downside risk and excess returns, do some more jugglary in terms of percentages allocated to various parameters. Then all the funds of a category are separated into different star groups, the top 10% are awarded 5star rating, next 22.5% 4 star \(so the top third are 4/5 star\). 
4. All these ratings are purely Quantitative without any subjective component. So, if the main catalyst of all fund selection – eg the fund manager, leaves, there will be no change in the rating. Even, the complete change of the entire management team like Fidelity leaving lock-stock-and-barrel does not change the rating of their funds which have been taken over by L&T with a new team. Amazing, if you really look at it.
5. Then these ratings are disseminated to people in various forms and adverts. And people flock to the 4 and 5 star funds. 

What are the problems in this way? Is it not better to use 4/5 star funds than to use the lower performing funds \(the 1 and 2 star funds\)?. Yes, selecting funds on basis of stars can be a good start, since most of the long term decent funds are 3 or 4 or 5 funds. But the problems are:

1. The ratings are calculated every week / month \(as per category\). So, it is possible for ratings of individual funds to change every week/month. So, a person who invested in 5 star fund on Friday may end up getting units allocated in a 4 star on Monday. How bad will that be for the person, and what will he do now with that pathetic looking 4 star fund \(sarcasm!\).
2. In star rating system, there are no subjective criteria, which makes comparison of the performance of the same fund under different managers / management teams uncomparable.
3. **Biggest problem is a 5 star fund may not remain 5 star** 2-3-5-10 years down the line. Then what are you going to do and how will you cope up with that. Past performance is not an indicator of future returns, which just means ranking based on past returns cannot tell you if the 5 star fund will remain 5 star 10 years down the line OR the 2/3 star fund will become one. So, all calculations of alpha, beta, standard deviation, volatility, etc BASED on past 1 year \(this is most common time frame for these values\) cannot tell you the future performance.
4. Comparison of a different style of fund like Value funds \(Eg are Templeton India Growth / Templeton India Equity Income and ICICI Discovery\) with Growth funds does not work since they are not comparable at all, even if their benchmarks and portfolio capitalizations are similar.
5. Then, if the top 10% of a group are 5 star out of say 20 \(which means top 2 will be 5 star\). Now let us say, there are 200 funds, then the top 20 funds will be 5 star. So, even though the relative ranking of a fund has dropped from say 2 to 20, it will retain its 5 star ranking - it just needs a constant increase in the number of funds and relative good performance. 

So how to cope?

1. Look behind the Quantitative performances of funds. You can start with the Qualitative Analyses provided by [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.in/featured-reports.aspx) for a start. Understand the Fund Company behind the fund. Have they been stable in retaining their management teams? Are they able to generate profits for themselves? If they are not, then it will be difficult for them to retain their teams for longer periods of time or sustain themselves, both of which can prove to be harmful for you.
2. Is the fund manager\(s\) been with this fund for the last 3-5 years \(over which the ratings have been generated and which has attracted you to it\)?
3. Is the style of fund consistent over these time periods? And can you stomach that style? Value funds can have long periods of relative underperformance followed by great outperformance as compared to growth funds. Similarly, large cap funds will have lesser volatility than say multicap or mid-small cap funds.

If after selecting funds across these parameters, the fund ratings drop, then you just need to check whether the fund team is still consistent in their approach and their underperformance is because of market cycle. In that case, it will be more beneficial to accumulate more units of the same fund which will help you when the fund regains or upgrades its ratings.

**Remember, you make most of your money in Bear Markets, the only problem is you do not know at that time.**

## SIP and Mandates

Most retail investors prefer SIPs over any other mode of investments, reason being it's automated, and drives the whole thing on auto-pilot.

It should be abundantly clear that SIP only automates the process of investing, and keeps investors disciplined. It's a behavioral easing tool.

If you manually purchase \(lumpsum first purchase, or additional purchase\), for same amount, on SIP date; you'd receive same NAV and units against those NAVs.

**There's no difference in return, whether you invest via SIP or invest manually, as long as it's the same amount on same dates as SIP dates, in same set of funds**.

SIP puts your investments on auto-pilots. That's all.

#### Benefits and Downsides

Before we go into how this automation works in SIP, it's better to understand what are benefits and downsides of this automation.

It's certainly helpful for the fund house. Steady cash-inflow committment means fund management can project their future income with some certainty. There's a reason why SIPs are promoted to investors so much so often in past decade, that it's synonymous with investing and investment assets itself.

Benefits for the investor:

* Can just _set it and forget it_, then focus on other areas of job, life etc.
* Prevents looking at the market before investing, thereby removes some bias a lot of people might have.
* Helps investor avoid seeing large losses up front.

Potential downsides could be:

* Keeping you out of the market

  SIP is a form of rupee-cost-averaging, but it also keeps your entire principal from getting into market at once.

* False sense of security

  Just because you're averaging purchase price, doesn't mean you would not see losses. If market is trending down, no SIP can prevent you from seeing losses.

  It's possible to get low returns after years of SIP. There are small-cap funds that have had zero or sub-zero returns after certain 5-year periods of SIP.

  Equity is a volatile and risky asset, and it's better to accept that.

* Returns vs Corpus

  People are obsessed with returns, and less focused on final corpus. Say, you did an SIP, which generated 11% p.a. return in a year. Also assume, if you had made a lumpsum investment at the beginning of the year in the same asset, it would've generated 9% p.a. return.

  Even if SIP return is higher here, corpus size would be higher for lumpsum investment.

  It's easy to show this assuming initial investment of 120 INR vs 12 month SIP of 10 INR per month. In SIP, return of 11% would be applicable to each leg of SIP, but for varying duration.

  Investing 120 INR all at once would've taken corpus to `120 * (1 + 9/100) INR = 130.8 INR` over a year.

  Investing via 10 INR / month SIP, would've generated 127 INR \(refer to any online SIP calculator\).

  Despite being able to get higher return, the lumpsum one wins out, because the corpus experienced those returns longer.

  It's possible to get higher return from SIP, and yet lose out in final corpus, compared to a lumpsum with lower return over same period.

What people don't realize, is even if they are doing SIP, they are still investing using lumpsum mode.

When you do a monthly 10k SIP in a bluechip equity fund, you are doing it because that's the most you can afford to invest that month. And if you could invest more, you would've had a bigger SIP amount.

Real question of rupee-cost-averaging arises when you come into huge capital, comparable to your annual income or more, but much higher than your monthly income.

In a situation like this, is it wise to invest all of it at once, or do an STP \(Systematic-Transfer-Plan\)? That's a topic for a separate discussion, and not within scope of this one.

#### How SIPs Work?

At the time of writing this, it's to be noted that not all SIPs are _real SIP_.

A real SIP is one where fund house recognizes it as a systematic purchase. It'd be marked as such, in your account statement from fund house or RTA. Even your CAS \(consolidated account statement\) would mark it as a systematic purchase.

There are platforms \(Coin, Piggy, MFUtility etc.\) that offer some form of pseudo-SIP, which would be an SIP from your point of view \(money getting automatically debited from bank, and invested into a fund, every month\), but the fund house won't record it as an SIP purchase.

This is an important distinction process-wise, i.e., how it works under-the-hood; but as mentioned above, won't make a difference in your corpus size or return.

Going forward, when we use the term SIP, we'd mean to say "real SIP" - one that shows up as systematic purchase in your account statement.

SIP is a contract between three parties:

* You
* Your bank
* Biller Intermediary / Fund house

There are platforms like BSE StAR or MFUtility or even PayTM Money, that can act as biller intermediaries for SIPs. It doesn't necessarily have to be an AMC or fund house.

Biller intermediary sends a bill to your bank in advance \(some send in 30 days advance, while some like BSE might send it 9 days in advance\), before your SIP date.

Assume you've an SIP 5th of a month. Then, about 10 days before \(around 25th of previous month\) that your bank would get a bill for SIP amount from the biller intermediary.

Your bank might or might not notify you, depending on what alerts you're supposed to get from bank.

This gets queued in bank's internal bill processing systems, and would be processed on 5th of the month, as that's your SIP date.

Processing of bill means the bank would debit this SIP amount, present on the bill, and send it to biller intermediary.

Biller intermediary would forward that amount to fund house or its RTA, along with details of your SIP purchase \(your personal details, folio number, fund name, amount of SIP etc.\).

Now comes the question - _how can a biller intermediary send bill and take money out from my account, without my consent or explicit intervention? Don't they need a netbanking OTP?_

That brings us to the next point - _Mandate_.

#### Bank Mandates

A mandate is an authorization from your end, that this certain biller, identified by a specific URN, can approach the bank at any time with a bill and directly debit your bank account without needing any intervention from you.

Mandate creation takes some time - banks wait for a while \(cooling-off period, or time-to-set-up\), to allow the account holder to come forward, in case this was set up mistakenly or if this was a fraudulent activity.

There are more than one ways to set up a mandate. Note that a mandate is specific to a biller, and linked to URN of the biller.

Generally speaking, these are different types of mandates:

* NACH mandate

  Can be set up via paper-form submission at bank by your biller. Bank verifies it based on your signature matching with the one in bank's record.

  Takes up to 30-45 days to set up.

* e-NACH mandate with Aadhar \(deprecated now\)

  NPCI had an Aadhar OTP based mandate set-up process, but it was rendered obsolete through judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in September 2018.

  Basically, if you had an Aadhar linked to your bank account, you could authorize the mandate with an Aadhar OTP to NPCI.

  Use to take up to 4-5 days to set up.

  This covered most banks in India, except a few PSB ones not under NPCI framework \(like, Allahabad bank, for example\).

* Billpay Mandate \(most common\)

  Some billers have special deals and contracts with some of the big banks uin India, that you'd find them listed in bill payment section of the netbanking portal or app from the bank.

  Most fund houses, and biller intermediaries like BSE StAR would be listed as pre-authorized biller in portals / apps of HDFC, SBI, ICICI, IDBI, Kotak, Axis, Yes Bank, Federal Bank etc.

  If this is the case for you, you can simply select the biller of your choice, and enter URN provided by your biller in your netbanking portal / bank app.

  Takes up to 7 days to set-up. And once set up, you can modify the limit amount from your bank portal itself.

So, which one should you use? As always with most things, _it depends_.

NACH is universal process for mandate creation. It'd work with any biller, any bank. It's time-consuming, but works. However, it's also error-prone, because it's verified based on signature.

Billpay mandate is most convenient and transparent to end users - you can easily delete the biller from netbanking later if you wish to delete the mandate, you can even stop payments on some incoming bills through netbanking \(some banks offer this\).

Sometimes, biller intermediaries like BSE would allow paying for a lumpsum order with NACH or e-NACH mandate. For you, the end user, the process is one-click. You don't have to wait for any OTP, no need to worry about payment failures. Just place the order in lumpsum mode, and let the biller reach out to your bank to deduct the payment - one-time.

You could think of it as _one-click payment_.

But BSE as an intermediary don't allow for lumpsum payments with Billpay mandate \(the mandate you've set up via netbanking\).

There's one process of mandate being tried out by Zerodha and PayTM Money - creation of e-NACH Mandates via digital signing from netbanking. This mandate, once created, might not be visible in your netbanking portal or banking app. However, we haven't included it yet, because it's a new process, and not enough feedback is available on its failure rates, convenience etc.

#### FAQ

These are some common queries we see in advice threads and other corners of internet, regarding SIPs and mandates.

* _**My SIP date was today, but no money has been deducted yet. What do I do now?**_

  This is an aspect of MF you've to learn and remember - unless it's a liquid fund and order amount is above 2L; fund house can process orders without actually receiving the amount.

  It's to account for payment gateway delays, bank bill-processing delays etc.

  All order confirmation emails from fund house or RTAs carry this warning: _units allotted are provisional and subject to fund realization_.

  Actual bank debit might happen on same day as SIP date, or next business day after SIP date.

  However, you should contact customer support of the intermediary, if the amount hasn't been debited from your bank even after one or two business days from designated SIP date.

  You'll get NAV of the actual SIP date \(effective SIP date, if actual SIP date was a holiday that month\)

* _**Today is my SIP date, but it's a Sunday. What do I do now?**_

  Relax. If SIP date is a holiday or non-trading day in a certain month, it'd be processed on next available trading / business day.

  You'd get NAV of that effective SIP date. It won't cancel or fail your SIP.

* _**It says first payment can be made now. Would this be lumpsum or SIP? Which NAV would I get?**_

  Assume you want to start an SIP on 20th of a month, and today is 1st.

  Some platforms and most AMCs would give you an option to make first-purchase on 1st of the month itself, for that installment.

  It'd be a lumpsum payment, with SIP limits applicable - but it doesn't matter, because we've already discussed above that mode of investment has no bearing on your returns or investment corpus.

  You'd get NAV of 1st, and not that of 20th. And your SIP would start next month of 20th \(because this month's installment is going in today as first purchase\).

* _**What should be the payment limit of mandate I'm setting up?**_

  Most likely, your intermediary you're transacting with, would give you a recommended amount. You're better off following that.

  Note that, you cannot edit a NACH or e-NACH mandate, same way you can edit a bill-pay mandate. So, it makes sense to set a high amount as limit for NACH mandates.

  It should be higher than SIP amount you're planning to invest.

  Actual debit from bank would be your SIP amount, not your payment limit.

  Payment limit is a daily limit on how big a bill your biller can send. It's there for security reasons, same way your Debit card has a purchase and withdrawal limit.

* _**Can I migrate my mandate to another platform?**_

  In almost all cases, you won't be able to. Mandate is identified by URN, and as you switch platform, your biller's URN would be different.

  You'll have to cancel the existing mandate, set up a new mandate following process & guidelines of new biller / intermediary.

* _**How do I delete this mandate I have?**_

  If it's a billpay mandate set up through your netbanking or banking app, you can delete it yourself.

  For other types of mandate, you can approach your bank and the intermediary. Most banks ask you to visit a branch in person to remove mandates, but some banks would also accept it over email.

  If you're having issues with removing a mandate, your bank's relationship team is better suited to handle this query.

| Jan 2004 | 53.9 | again a 150% increase. |
| Jan 2005 | 61 | just 11% |
| Jan 2006 | 92.9 | 50% more |
| Jan 2007 | 132 | 50% more |
| Jan 2008 | 181 | 50% more & 9 times in last 5 years. |
| Jan 2009 | 97 | lost 50% in 1 year. |
| Jan 2010 | 186 | gained 100% again |
| Jan 2011 | 217 | an 11% increase |
| Jan 2012 | 196 | a 10% loss. |
| Jan 2013 | 241 | 20% increase. |
| Jan 2014 | 242 | flat. |

Few conclusions:

1. This is a conservative large cap fund. Even then the gyrations are very strong.
2. Returns in equity funds have always been volatile, even 20 years ago and the increased volatility is not a new thing.
3. There can be long periods \(8 years in this series\) in which the NAV has not gone anywhere between the start and the end.
4. The near or medium term past performance is completely different from what is going to happen in the future. There can be a huge spike in 1 year followed by all the way of retracement OR there can be 4 years of unbelievable increases with sudden whip-lash.

### Part 2: Separate Equity and Debt Funds

Data used: NAV of Franklin Blue Chip and Templeton Income Builder Account funds, since their inceptions.

Modifications: Used average monthly NAVs for analysis. I did not put the 2%/1% investment charge which was there for most of the period.

Asset Allocation Basics:

1. Started in July 1997, since that is the first month of the income fund.
2. Started with monthly investment of 10,000, with yearly increase of 10-15% every financial year.
3. Used different styles of portfolio management / asset allocation as detailed below.
4. Total investment amount from Jul 1997 to Feb 2014 has been 69L.

| Type of Asset Allocation | Total Corpus amount | CAGR | Std Dev | Max Drawdown | Ulcer Index |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pure Equity | 2.20 crore | 18.6% | 26% | -57.7% | 19% |
| Pure Debt | 1.11 crore | 8.9% | 3% | -2.7% | 0% |
| Auto 60:40 | 1.76 crore | 16.7% | 16.0% | -32.3% | 8% |
| Auto 70:30 | 1.82 crore | 17.0% | 18.0% | -39.0% | 10% |

Pure Equity / Debt - In this, all money was put into the equity / debt fund.

Auto 60:40 / 70:30- If the asset allocation of equity was &lt;= 60% \(or 70%\), then the monthly investment was done into the equity fund, otherwise the money was put into the debt fund. No amount of money from transferred from one asset to another even when the asset allocation was out of range to avoid taxes.

Max Drawdown- This is the amount by which the total corpus suffered from its peak \(the maximum downside\).

Ulcer Index- supposed to be a better indicator of [Risk](http://www.tangotools.com/ui/ui.htm) compared to SD.

Few Conclusions:

1. For the first 6-8 odd years, there is no significant difference between any of the methods, since the monthly amount was a big chunk \(hypothesis that till the monthly amount is about 1% of the total corpus, there is not much of a difference in the amounts provided all other parameters are kept same. 100 months = 8 odd years\).
2. There is not much of a difference between a 60:40 and a 70:30 asset allocation.
3. For long periods of time \(some years\), all monthly investments were done in one or the other asset to bring back the ratio to the prescribed levels.

### Part 3: Using Mid and Small Cap fund

Data used: NAV of Franklin Prima [a mid and small cap fund](http://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=115) and Templeton Income Builder Account funds, since their inceptions.

The basics and methodology is similar as from [Part 2](http://redd.it/1xoz8e).

| Type of Asset Allocation | Total Corpus amount | CAGR | Std Dev | Max Drawdown | Ulcer Index |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pure Equity | 3.01 crore \(2.20\) | 23.3% \(18.6\) | 29%\(26\) | -63.3%\(-57.7\) | 19%\(19\) |
| Pure Debt \(same\) | 1.11 crore | 8.9% | 3% | -2.7% | 0% |
| Auto 60:40 | 2.15 crore \(1.76\) | 19.7%\(16.7\) | 18.4%\(16.0\) | -45.0%\(-32.3\) | 11%\(8\) |
| Auto 70:30 | 2.32 crore \(1.82\) | 20.7%\(17.0\) | 20.1%\(18.0\) | -48.0\(-39.0\) | 12%\(10\) |

The numbers in brackets represent the values when Franklin Blue Chip fund was used instead of Franklin Prima fund.

Another chart which compares the Pure Prima fund, Pure Bluechip fund, and a 60:40 allocations of both the funds. [Link](http://imgur.com/JGQDbHA).

Few Conclusions:

1. The returns using Franklin Prima fund show more return with even more volatility, as compared to with using Franklin Blue Chip fund, along all parameters \(100%, 60:40 and 70:30\). 
2. The maximum drawdown in case of balanced \(60:40 or 70:30\) asset allocation is still high \(nearly 50%\), which means even with partial rebalancing, the corpus can go down to half of the peak \(this is a chilling thought\). This is shown in the Ulcer Index too.
3. It is interesting to note that the Ulcer Index of Pure Equity in both the cases is same \(at 19%\).
4. The pure large cap fund almost behaves similar to the 60:40 equity:debt combination of the mid-small cap fund. Only in the later years, the pure equity fund has taken a slight lead. While the 70:30 combination slightly leads the pure large cap equity. **This means that a balanced fund with mid and small cap leanings \(eg HDFC Prudence\) behaves like a pure large cap equity fund.**

**EDIT:**

For a pure investment into HDFC Prudence, the values are:

| Type of Asset Allocation | Total Corpus amount | CAGR | Std Dev | Max Drawdown | Ulcer Index |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pure HDFC Prudence | 2.60 crore | 21.0% | 16.9% | -42.2% | 9% |

This is even more surprising. The Ulcer Index and Std Dev are nearly the same as the large cap 60:40 ratio, while the returns are much better than any other combination with either the Prima or the Blue Chip fund, except for pure Prima fund. The corresponding [Chart](http://imgur.com/BCu9YoT).
