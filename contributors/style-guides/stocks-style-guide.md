# Stocks Style Guide

This article is meant to serve as a style guide on how to write content in the [Stocks](../../stocks/can-you-beat-the-market.md) section. 

This isn’t a strict requirement but a general recommendation or advice about how to approach writing content which meets the level of quality we’re looking for in the Stocks section.

This is in addition to our general style guide

#### Use a Beginner Friendly Writing Style Comment <a id="Use-a-Beginner-Friendly-Writing-Style"></a>

Unless something has already been covered in one of the sections written before, please don’t assume that the reader would know about it. This doesn’t mean that content should be dumbed down, but it should be easy to approach such that understanding it doesn’t feel uncomfortable.

This might be a bit hard to grasp but don’t write as if you’re a robot writing dry commentary or producing _TL;DR_ styled content. Write as if you’re thinking out loud in your own mind although avoid using first person references like _I_, _me_, _you_ etc. Using _we_, _oneself_, _one can assume…_ is preferable.

#### Use Examples <a id="Use-Examples"></a>

Use actual examples that readers can relate to. Talking about something and actually showing how it happens in real life are vastly different things. If talking about valuation, use an example that shows how to arrive at it.

If talking about a financial ratio, use images from an annual report and show the reader how to calculate that ratio. In other words, show the reader how & from where input values needed to calculate a ratio are derived from.

For example, while explaining how to calculate Working Capital of a company, explain how input values Current Assets & Current Liabilities can be found in a company’s balance sheet, and company’s balance sheet can be found in the latest Annual report of the company.

#### Dive Deep Into Details When Necessary <a id="Dive-Deep-Into-Details-When-Necessary"></a>

If, and when, necessary, feel free to dive into details while keeping efficiency in mind. In such cases, try to understand the entire concept yourself, sketch out a summary or a bird's-eye view of the concept, and then write about it. If a wall of text has to be written, try to make it engaging and somewhat fun to read by adding relevant images, examples, and other interactive elements.

#### When in doubt, ask <a id="When-in-doubt-ask"></a>

If you’re writing content for a chapter and feel stuck in any part of the process, do let us know. We’d love to guide you on what needs to be covered, and how. We’ve a draft of talking points for each chapter of the series, and a rough idea on how they need to be explained. Feel free to DM the core contribution team, or drop a message in \#kb-due-diligence for any help regarding coverage, structuring, phrasing or any other issues you face while contributing.
