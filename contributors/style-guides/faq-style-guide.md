# General Style Guide

## Intro üëã

This document should serve as a standard guideline on how to write for [r/IndiaInvestments](https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments) wiki.

There's no _one true_ way of writing it. But when working on a collaborative project such as this, we all should agree with certain ground rules, to have uniform content throughout our knowledge base.  
  
It also helps reviewers, reducing cognitive load on what to watch out for.

Following points are meant as a way to help you form an article from scratch. We can then tweak it later, based on review feedback.

## Tone üéµ

It should have a balanced tone. No need to be overly aggressive / abusive / cocky / snarky. Simultaneously, avoid being overly cute or too nice. Basically, avoid emotional hot-takes, or controversial flame-baits.

Standard text, with somewhat firmness is well suited. Write less. Break complex sentences down to simpler ones. Use periods more than conjunctions.

Avoid phrases like _in my humble opinion_ \(you're writing it, of course it's in your opinion. Duh!\), or _correct me if I'm wrong_, or _I'm no lawyer_. Similarly, avoid raining emojis.

Furnish information that you can, and avoid taking the note in a direction that you're not comfortable with.

In particular, avoid passive mode wherever possible. Sure, it's not always avoidable - sometimes a sentence may even have no other choice but to omit the subject.

But for most scenarios, active voice is better suited.

## Wall of text üß±

Reading a _large wall of text_ can be unsettling, and boring.

Strive to not have paragraphs **more than 1-2 sentences long**. If you're writing a paragraph that's more than three sentences long, you're doing something wrong.

We're not looking for dense academic dissertations.

## Be unbiased ‚òØÔ∏è 

A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself this: _if someone reads this 5 years from now, how much change would this text need to remain relevant?_

Focus on producing _evergreen_ content.

For example, you might be tempted to write _Product X is not right for you, it doesn't even have feature Y_.

Except, five years from now, it might. Or, maybe this feature Y won't even be needed five years down the line.

A better sentence would be _At the time of writing this, product X doesn't support Y. You may consider it if that changes_.

Avoid opinions. It's okay to say _historically equity has beaten inflation over the long term, at least in the last 40 years._

But it's not okay to phrase it as _equity is the only asset that'd perform better than inflation_.

No one can predict that.

## Linking to external resources üåè

In course of creating a content, you‚Äôd be tempted to link to an external resource - some blog post, news articles, videos, other community posts from Reddit / Valuepickr / TradingQnA etc.

**Don‚Äôt**.

At least not directly to that resource.

Links can be taken down / removed / made inaccessible. As much as possible, from the beginning, we‚Äôve taken steps to not let that happen.

Ideally, we‚Äôd want to link to Internet Archive‚Äôs archived version of that link. [Wikipedia was able to restore nearly 9 million dead links with this](https://blog.archive.org/2018/10/01/more-than-9-million-broken-links-on-wikipedia-are-now-rescued/). Google web-cache can also be used.

Here‚Äôs how a sample link to CNN‚Äôs coverage of Buffet‚Äôs Annual Shareholder letter of 2021 might look like:

[Real Link](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/27/investing/warren-buffett-annual-letter/index.html) \| [archive.org link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301184753/https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/27/investing/warren-buffett-annual-letter/index.html) \| [archive.is link](https://archive.is/nnPAV).  
  
Take this tweet from NSE India official twitter handle: [https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984](https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984). This is a status update communication regarding system downtime at NSE.  
  
We can reasonably expect for this link to stay up. However, just to be safe, add these links as well.  
  
[Link to actual tweet](https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984) \| [archive.org link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301045907/https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984) \| [archive.is link](https://archive.is/9ceKG)

You could use Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback machine to search for a latest archived version yourself.

Alternatively, you could use these extensions / plugins in your browsers, to get the archived versions:

* [Firefox Web Archive](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/view-page-archive/)
* [Chrome Web Archives](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-archives/hkligngkgcpcolhcnkgccglchdafcnao)

### Reddit links

When it comes to Reddit links, especially links to a comment or post; we've decided to provide four links, instead of three.  
  
Reddit is a social platform, with multiple clients and readers out there, which aid users across the world consume its content. Aside from the _new.reddit_ and _old.reddit_ web platforms; Reddit also have plethora of mobile clients - Joey, Apollo, and many others; aside from the official Reddit app.  
  
To allow users to continue consuming the content from Reddit on their choice of client / reader service, we need to provide these three or four links:  
  
[www.reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/dnemrb/norway_pension_fund_a_1t_fund_for_people_of_norway/) \| [old.reddit link](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/dnemrb/norway_pension_fund_a_1t_fund_for_people_of_norway/) \|  [archive.is link](https://archive.is/GXPB1)  
  
The first link with `www` subdomain, allows readers to open it in their favorite Reddit clients. Second link allows good number of _Redditors_, who still prefer the older UI \(because it renders all comments in a simple HTML, and not just top comments in a thread\), easily consume the content.

## Miscellaneous ü¶ã

* Avoid referring to yourself in first person. _I_, _me_, _we_, _present author_ etc. pronouns / phrases are best avoided. 
* Keep asking yourself _who's the intended reader for this?_  For instance, if you're writing chapter 5 of a series, then you can reasonably assume the reader would be well-versed in content entries from previous four chapters of the same series. No need to repeat any concept already covered in first four chapters preceding that.  However, if the content is not something a reader is supposed to know, it's best if you explain in 2-3 sentences.  Make the content as _beginner friendly_ as possible, without compromising quality. To that end, use examples to illustrate a concept. Or, use diagrams \(tools like Excalidraw can help with this\), or tables, or even images or videos.  Beginner friendly coverage of concepts are comprehensive. If you write a specific concept once, so anyone who didn't understand that before can now grasp it reading that content - it benefits every other contributor out there.  Because they can simply refer to that in their writing, without having to covering same concept.  
* No plagiarism  


  If you have read an online article or blog post whose content you wish to use, read & understand it first; then write in your own language. Also credit the original source.

  You can quote a source, as long as you cite it properly.  


  But copy-pasting verbatim from a source and trying to pass it off as your own work would invite troubles for you. We do this check before inserting every piece of content into the wiki. And it's surprisingly easy to discover when someone copies even a single paragraph from external sources.  

* After writing an entry, **read it yourself**, before you ask others to review it.  


  That alone would help you catch common errors or issues with it, before others even need to review it.
